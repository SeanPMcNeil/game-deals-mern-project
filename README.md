#### About
The goal of Game Deals is to help users find the best current deals on PC games across a variety of digital storefronts. 

#### Tech Used
- MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)
- Tailwind CSS
- RAWG API
- CheapShark API

#### Highlights
- Utilizing two APIs for completing the game search, then feeding data from that API call into the second API to complete a query for game deals.
- Utilized Tailwind CSS to create a dynamic, interactive page to provide feedback to users as they browse.

#### Future Considerations
- Research different API options to avoid naming conflicts between the two during game searches/deal lookups
- Potential monetization options through affiliate programs. Would need a way to dynamically build links based on where the deals are located.
